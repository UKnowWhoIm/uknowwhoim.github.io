I&amp;rsquo;m just a curious kid who loves solving real world problems using code.
My brief history in programming I developed an interest towards programming when we where taught QBasic in 6th grade. That interest grew when I was introduced to HTML in 8th grade, we were taught how to create a form but not how to handle it, so I looked for answers on my own and found PHP.</description></item><item><title>Aion Creative Wings</title><link>https://example.com/work-experience/aion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/work-experience/aion/</guid><description>About This was an intership for a startup of a college senior. We were a team of 10 interns working on different projects.
What did I learn and experience? Flutter from scratch. How to deploy a lightweight app without backend on FireStore. This was my first collaborative project, so I understood all the benefits of a team behind you. What did we build?</description></item><item><title>Chess Bot</title><link>https://example.com/projects/chess-bot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/projects/chess-bot/</guid><description>Go to TLDR
I had done Multiplayer Chess as my school project, redid the same on django after learning it. Then I looked into chess programming. At first I was just curious, but I soon learned about MiniMax, Alpha Beta pruning, etc.
To test the waters, I made an AI for a simple game like Othello. After I successfully created a challenging AI for Othello, I proceeded to start doing it for Chess.</description></item><item><title>ClusterDev</title><link>https://example.com/work-experience/cluster-dev/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/work-experience/cluster-dev/</guid><description>About I&amp;rsquo;m currently a Software Engineer Intern at ClusterDev. My work is mainly focused on their product Manglish Keyboard.
What did I learn and experience? Learned that even a seemingly small app like a keyboard has lots of complex stuff like autocorrect behind the scenes. The thrill of knowing that there are no correct answers to some problems Actually realized the importance of complex DSA and Math to optimize and solve variety of problems</description></item><item><title>Django Test Action</title><link>https://example.com/projects/django-tests-action/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/projects/django-tests-action/</guid><description>This is a github action built using Docker to run your django tests to ensure that you don&amp;rsquo;t break existing stuff while making new changes
I made this project while working at QAPP, as we integrated tests into our codebase.</description></item><item><title>Members List Action</title><link>https://example.com/projects/members-list-action/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/projects/members-list-action/</guid><description>A college senior suggested an idea, to automatically create a list of members of a github organization.
At the time I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what a github action was, so I learned about github actions by doing this small project.
Doing this project allowed me to learn about Github Actions and Workflows, which are indispensable tools to have as a maintainer.</description></item><item><title>Multiplayer Chess</title><link>https://example.com/projects/chess/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/projects/chess/</guid><description>This is an online multiplayer chess game implemented using express.js, websockets, MongoDB and JS at its core.

I had a great learning experience and a chance to give back to the society.
What did I learn and experience? Went deep into DRF. Experienced a client whose requirements change daily. An oppurtunity to work with a really experienced developer. What did we build? An API for COVID-19 District Management, including Hospital allocation, Ambulance allocation, Storing Patient Data, etc.</description></item><item><title>QAPP</title><link>https://example.com/work-experience/qapp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/work-experience/qapp/</guid><description>About QAPP was developed during the start of the COVID19 pandemic. We were just 2 developers who built the entire thing, so it taught me very much.
What did I learn and experience? Increased my flutter &amp;amp; DRF proficency. Closely experienced the benefits and problems faced by startups. What did we build? A queue management system for effective social distancing using flutter and DRF.</description></item><item><title>Skills</title><link>https://example.com/skills/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/skills/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Student Benefits API</title><link>https://example.com/projects/student-mail-benefits/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/projects/student-mail-benefits/</guid><description>This is an Open API containing many student discounts and offers. This was made using a mix of vanilla django and DRF.
Made this API once I realised that many students aren&amp;rsquo;t aware of the incredible amount of free stuff they&amp;rsquo;re eligible.</description></item><item><title>Whatsapp Telegram Bridge</title><link>https://example.com/projects/whatsapp-telegram-bridge/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/projects/whatsapp-telegram-bridge/</guid><description>Go to TLDR
As the deadline for accepting WhatsApp&amp;rsquo;s new release was approaching, our class group was engaged in a heated discussion about moving to telegram. Many wanted to, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t as the official group containing teachers, would have to be in whatsapp, as the teachers had no interest in moving.
Seeing the argument getting nowhere, I saw a suggestion that if we could somehow bridge the apps, we could achieve the best of both worlds.</description></item></channel></rss>
