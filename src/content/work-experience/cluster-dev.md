### About
I'm currently a Software Engineer Intern at ClusterDev. My work is mainly focused on their product [Manglish Keyboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clusterdev.malayalamkeyboard&hl=en_IN&gl=US).

### What did I learn and experience?
- Learned that even a seemingly small app like a keyboard has lots of complex stuff like autocorrect behind the scenes.
- The thrill of knowing that there are no correct answers to some problems
- Actually realized the importance of complex DSA and Math to optimize and solve variety of problems
