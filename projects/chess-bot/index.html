<p>Go to <a href=#tldr>TLDR</a></p>
<p>I had done Multiplayer Chess as my school project, redid the same on django after learning it. Then I looked into chess programming. At first I was just curious, but I soon learned about MiniMax, Alpha Beta pruning, etc.</p>
<p>To test the waters, I made an AI for a simple game like Othello. After I successfully created a challenging AI for Othello, I proceeded to start doing it for Chess.</p>
<p>Othello AI was made in django, but I really didn&rsquo;t notice the performance issues as the game was simple, but when it came to chess, I was stuck. Even my best optimizations couldn&rsquo;t get me past 3 levels.</p>
<p>It was then I decided to turn to C++, after a senior talked some sense into me, I redid the entire thing in C++. Even the initial unoptimized version in C++ performed way better than in python. Eventually I managed to optimize this to look 7 moves ahead in reasonable time(&lt;20s).</p>
<p><strong>This project made me realize the importance of using the right tools for the right job.</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a dream of mine to improve this project, to atleast challenge the average player.</p>

<p>This is a chess bot, written in C++. As of now, it&rsquo;s just a challenge for only beginner chess players.</p>
