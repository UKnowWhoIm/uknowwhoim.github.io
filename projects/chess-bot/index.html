I had done Multiplayer Chess as my school project, redid the same on django after learning it. Then I looked into chess programming. At first I was just curious, but I soon learned about MiniMax, Alpha Beta pruning, etc.
To test the waters, I made an AI for a simple game like Othello. After I successfully created a challenging AI for Othello, I proceeded to start doing it for Chess."><meta name=keywords content="developer,personal"><meta name=twitter:card content="summary"><meta name=twitter:title content="Chess Bot"><meta name=twitter:description content="Go to TLDR
