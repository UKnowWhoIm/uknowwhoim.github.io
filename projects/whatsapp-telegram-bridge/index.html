As the deadline for accepting WhatsApp&rsquo;s new release was approaching, our class group was engaged in a heated discussion about moving to telegram. Many wanted to, but couldn&rsquo;t as the official group containing teachers, would have to be in whatsapp, as the teachers had no interest in moving.
Seeing the argument getting nowhere, I saw a suggestion that if we could somehow bridge the apps, we could achieve the best of both worlds.">

<p>As the deadline for accepting WhatsApp&rsquo;s new release was approaching, our class group was engaged in a heated discussion about moving to telegram. Many wanted to, but couldn&rsquo;t as the official group containing teachers, would have to be in whatsapp, as the teachers had no interest in moving.</p>
<p>Seeing the argument getting nowhere, I saw a suggestion that if we could somehow bridge the apps, we could achieve the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>I browsed github casually, so I knew there were some good unofficial WhatsApp APIs, and telegram had an official API. So it wasn&rsquo;t much work bringing them together and linking a whatsapp chat to a telegram chat.</p>

<p>I made a node script to link an unofficial Whatsapp API with Telegram API, to recieve whatsapp chats on telegram.</p>
