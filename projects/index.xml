I had done Multiplayer Chess as my school project, redid the same on django after learning it. Then I looked into chess programming. At first I was just curious, but I soon learned about MiniMax, Alpha Beta pruning, etc.
To test the waters, I made an AI for a simple game like Othello. After I successfully created a challenging AI for Othello, I proceeded to start doing it for Chess.</description></item><item><title>Django Test Action</title><link>/projects/django-tests-action/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/django-tests-action/</guid><description>This is a github action built using Docker to run your django tests to ensure that you don&amp;rsquo;t break existing stuff while making new changes

At the time I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what a github action was, so I learned about github actions by doing this small project.
Doing this project allowed me to learn about Github Actions and Workflows, which are indispensable tools to have as a maintainer.</description></item><item><title>Multiplayer Chess</title><link>/projects/chess/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/chess/</guid><description>This is an online multiplayer chess game implemented using express.js, websockets, MongoDB and JS at its core.

This was made using a mix of vanilla django and DRF.
Made this API once I realised that many students aren&amp;rsquo;t aware of the incredible amount of free stuff they&amp;rsquo;re eligible.</description></item><item><title>Whatsapp Telegram Bridge</title><link>/projects/whatsapp-telegram-bridge/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/whatsapp-telegram-bridge/</guid><description>Go to TLDR
As the deadline for accepting WhatsApp&amp;rsquo;s new release was approaching, our class group was engaged in a heated discussion about moving to telegram. Many wanted to, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t as the official group containing teachers, would have to be in whatsapp, as the teachers had no interest in moving.
Seeing the argument getting nowhere, I saw a suggestion that if we could somehow bridge the apps, we could achieve the best of both worlds.</description></item></channel></rss>
